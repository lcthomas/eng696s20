# Schedule
## Week 1: Introduction
## Tuesday, January 14
In this class, we will discuss the course and our plan for the semester. You will sign up for workshop dates. We will discuss *why* we publish in the first place and answer some of the questions you submitted. We will also read, in class, an excerpt from a journal article and begin a discussion of the conventions of academic journal articles.

----

## Week 2:  What is a journal article?
## Tuesday, January 21
Due by class:
* Read Mimi Thi Nguyen, "The Hoodie as Sign, Screen, Expectation, and Force," *Signs*, 40.4 (Spring 2015): 791-816 (reading in Box folder)
* Complete reverse outline of Nguyen's article and submit to course Box folder

In this class, we will discuss the conventions of a journal article using an example, and discuss how a journal article is different from a dissertation chapter. You will complete a reverse outline of this article before coming to class.

----

## Week 3: Audience
## Tuesday, January 28
Due by class:
* A ranked list of the 3 journals to which you think you want to submit your piece, submitted to our course Box folder. For the **first journal** (and only the first journal!) on this list, you will do the following:
    * Spend some time reading and skimming the journal's most recent 3 years of issues, and select 3 articles you believe best represent this journal's current audience(s). For each article, identify:
       * The field(s) or subfield(s) in which the author specializes.
       * The field(s) or subfield(s) addressed by the article, explaining what has lead you to determine this.
    * Based on the information you gather in the step above, write 1-3 paragraphs on who you see as the major audience group(s) for this journal, and why you see your piece as a good fit for this journal.
    * Include information on submission guidelines, including length, citation style, submission format, the submission process, and any other information pertinent to manuscript submission that the journal offers on its website.

In this class, we will discuss the importance of audience in scholarly publishing. Come to class ready to discuss the above assignment. We will also discuss what an "ideal outline" is. You should begin writing your ideal outline after this week (due week 5).

**NOTE:** This assignment and next week's assignment are, obviously, organized around academic publications. However, some of you have indicated that you might be interested in exploring publication opportunities outside of peer-reviewed journals. If you are still considering this, please talk to me in advance of doing this week's assignment.

----

## Week 4: Citations and notes
## Tuesday, February 4
Due by class:
* Select one of the articles from your top-choice journal identified in last week's assignment and read it through carefully, paying particular attention to its citations and foot- or endnotes.
* After reading, write ~3-5 paragraphs identifying what you see as the most important conversations with which this article is signaling engagement via its citations and notes. Submit this writing to our Box folder. Your paragraphs should include answers to the following 3 questions:
    * What are the recent/current conversations with which this author is engaging?
    * What are the classic/foundational (for this field or fields, or for a discipline overall) conversations or pieces with which this author is engaging?
    * How does the author signal engagement with these conversations? Discuss 3 specific and **different** ways in which the author engages with preexisting work (by challenging that work, by building on it, by referring readers interested in more information on x topic to it, etc.)

For this class, we will discuss the role and importance of citations and notes. Come to class ready to discuss the above assignment. You should continue working on your ideal outline (due next week).

----

## Week 5: Ideal outline
## Tuesday, February 11
Due by class:
* An ideal outline for the piece you will be working with this semester, including a first draft of an article abstract. The more detailed you can make this outline, the better. Please submit a copy to our course Box folder, and bring 2 print copies to class. You will workshop this outline in class with a partner/in a small group.

We will workshop and discuss your ideal outlines in class. You will also create a plan for revision.
